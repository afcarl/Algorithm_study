# Lecture series

This folder is built for implementing some classic algorithms which mostly will be taught in class.

Because there exists some company which ask you to implement some basic wheels instead of use STL to solve other algorithm questions. And since many implmentations on Internet are too ugly to read, I decide to prepare my own implementations in case future use.

The list contains

### Sorting:

- [x] Mergesort

### Minimum spanning tree

- [ ] Prim algorithm
- [ ] kruskal algorithm

### Shortest path

- [ ] Dijkstra
- [ ] Floyd
- [ ] Bellman-ford
