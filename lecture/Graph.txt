This is my notes of studying graph algorithms.

1.Representation of grphs
  1) Adjacency list representation
     This is for sparse graph.

       Adjacency list template for my C++:

       #include <vector>
       vector<int> Graph[V];
       Graph[u].push_back(v);

       Standing for an edge connecting u and v.
       And there are totally V nodes.
